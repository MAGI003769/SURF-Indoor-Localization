# SURF-Indoor-Localization

## Overall:
2017 SURF: Indoor Localization </br>
Mainly relevant essential material, files and code. </br>
Hope this summer can be cool. </br>


## Folders:
- algorithm: holding relevant code for offline
- android: holding code of app for online
- Papers: relevant papers for research

## Problems:
1. In deep learning algorithm, the testing accuracy is much lower than training and validation.
- Resetting the ratio of training and validation 0.9
- dropout 0.5
- an strong relation between loss of AutoEncoder and final testing accuracy was observed. May be we should design a better AutoEncoder if necessary.
